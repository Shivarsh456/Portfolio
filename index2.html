            I was born in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. And I always had a passion for cricket. 
                These threads of family, Cricket, and academics have defined my life path and experiences. 
                I have completed my formal education from C.L.G. Inter college Prayagraj,U.P. and now 
                currently pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Goa. 
                I am a part of IIT Goa's Inter IIT team. Along this journey I have met a few amazing 
                people who completely change my life. Before I got into IIT Goa I was poor in communication, and then my 
                friends encouraged me and taught me many things in the last few years.

        <div class="projects">
            <p class="Para4">The project was based on "Biometric based Attendance System". When a student puts his finger or Biometric on finger print sensor, if it matches with one of the already stored biometric in memory then it will directly mark the attendance or else a buzzer will sound and a red alert will start to glow. My role in this projcet was to make the connection from Arduino to FPGA Board and circuit designing and a little bit of VHDL programming. </p>
            <p class="para5"> I have also worked on a mini project during my Workshop period. The project was based on creating My PORTFOLIO WEBSITE in which I have improved my Web Development skills. It was fun to learn Web Development and at the same time it was exciting to create my own PORTFOLIO WEBSITE. I have used HTML and CSS Programming languages to create My Portfolio.
